### Branch naming conventions + Conventional Commits
We follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages. This ensures a consistent commit history and enables automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Branch Naming Conventions 
```
<type>/<short-description>
```
Examples: 
- feature/{feature-name}
- fix/{bug-description}
- docs/{documentation-change}
### Commit Message
Follow this structure for commit messages
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```
Where:
```type``` has one of the following:
- feat: New features
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code formatting only
- refactor: Code changes without behavior change
- test: Adding or updating tests
- chore: Build process or tooling updates

### PR process
